# Movie Streaming Application

## Overview

This **full-stack movie streaming application** is built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. It allows users to browse and watch movies, manage profiles, and perform admin operations. The app features **JWT authentication**, **React Hooks**, and **Context API** for state management, creating a full-featured, interactive streaming platform made with MERN stack.

## Technical Working

The application integrates a **React frontend**, **Node.js backend**, and **MongoDB** database to handle dynamic content and user authentication. Key features include:

- **Backend API:** Node.js and Express.js manage API routes for users and movie CRUD operations.  
- **Database:** MongoDB stores users, movies, and lists, securely handling relationships.  
- **Authentication:** JWT-based registration and login with protected routes.  
- **React Frontend:** Components use React Hooks and **Context API** for state and global data management.  
- **Movie Listings:** Dynamic display of featured and categorized movies.  
- **Watch Page:** Movie detail pages with streaming-like functionality.  
- **Admin Panel:** Dashboard for managing movies, users, and statistics with CRUD operations.  
- **Charts & Analytics:** Admin dashboard charts showing user and movie stats.  
- **File Uploads:** Upload movie images and trailers using Firebase storage.  
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Error Handling:** Smooth handling of API errors, user inputs, and edge cases.  

The project demonstrates building a **modern streaming platform** with full-stack functionality, secure authentication, dynamic content, and admin management tools.
